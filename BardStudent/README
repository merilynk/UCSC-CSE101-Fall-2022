PROGRAM DESCRIPTION
This program takes in a list of Shakespearian words and adds them to an array of linked lists where the index of
the array corresponds to the lengths of the words stored in the linked list at that index. Each of the linked lists
are sorted by frequency of the words then by lexographical order. The program takes in another input file, 
querying each line and finding the word in the array of linked lists. The word is printed to the output file.

USAGE
1) Run "make", to get executable "bard".
2) Run "./bard <INPUT FILE> <OUTPUT FILE>"

CREDITS
Code for linkedlist.h and linkedlist.cpp from Sesh's linked list example.
Code for parsing input files are based on Sesh's linked list practice test wrapper.
